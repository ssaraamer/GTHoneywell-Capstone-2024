# üí° Honeywell Generative AI Project üí°
Monitoring industrial plant or organization processes are complicated, and finding a single reference document amongst gigabytes of data with traditional indexing methods can be tricky. Having engineers be able to interface with a Large Language Model to parse and collect this data would provide a huge productivity boost, and this project aims to develop such an application.

## üíæ Installation Guide
---
**üíø Pre-requisites**
---
### üìÅ File Download
 * Please clone this repository to your local machine. You may do so following these instructions: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository

### üéÆ Frontend Software requirements
  * Windows: Download the installer from this website per your machine requirements: https://nodejs.org/en/download
  * MacOS: In your terminal, run the following command: `brew install node`
  * Linux (Ubuntu): Run `sudo apt update` and then `sudo apt install nodejs npm`

### ‚å®Ô∏è Backend Software requirements
- There are two options to install all dependencies required. You can either use our conda virtual environment, or simply install all the dependencies from the requirements.txt file. Try both methods before reaching out for help! Installation via the requirements.txt file will generally lead to fewer issues. 
- Please see the [troubeshooting](https://github.gatech.edu/JIB-3315/JIB-3315_GenAIProject/edit/main/README.md#-troubleshooting) section below if you require any assistance!

### üêç Python Software
**1.  Python Installation:** If you already have Python installed on your machine, you can skip to Step #2. If not, please follow these instructions to install Python: 
- Windows: Run the downloaded installer. Ensure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" before clicking "Install Now". This step is crucial as it makes Python and pip accessible from the command line. https://www.python.org/downloads/
-  MacOS: Run the downloaded installer and follow the instructions. The installer typically handles all configuration settings including PATH adjustments.
-  Linux (Ubuntu): You probably already have Python installed!

**2. Option 1:** Requirements.txt-- Please recall that you can do EITHER step 2 or 3, please pick whichever one you prefer. 
   - Enter the directory of the Repository that you cloned. Once there, navigate to the `./project/backend` folder.
   - Then, run the following command in your terminal or command line: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

**3. Option 2:** Conda environment 
   - Install Anaconda or minconda from the Anaconda's official site if you don't already have it: https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/miniconda-install/
   - Open either CMD or Terminal, and navigate to the `./project/backend` folder. Run the following command `conda env create -f environment.yml`. 
   - Once that has finished running, run the following command to activate the environment `conda activate honeywellenv`.

### üë®‚Äçüíª Local Database Setup _**Note-- Required for Responses to Function_
**1. Install PostgreSQL:** You can download and install PostgreSQL from the official PostgreSQL website linked here: https://www.postgresql.org/download/. During the installation process, remember your PostgreSQL username and password. Do NOT install using Homebrew.

**2. pgAdmin:** After installing PostgreSQL, install pgAdmin, which is a popular open-source administration and development platform for PostgreSQL. Download it from the pgAdmin website linked here: https://www.pgadmin.org/download/ and follow the configuration instructions.

**3. Set up DB:** Open your terminal or cmd. Navigate to the `/.project/backend` folder. Run the following command `psql -U jib -d chatbot -f chatbot.sql`. Then, enter the password `3315`. _Note: This only needs to be done on first installation_

**üì± Running the Application**
---
* Run Fast-API server:** Open your terminal or cmd. Navigate to the `/.project/backend` folder. Run the following command `uvicorn main:app --reload`. You can go to http://localhost:8000/docs#/default/home__get to see the Fast-API UI.
* In the main directory, there is a file titled `start_project.py`
* If all installations were able to execute, you should be able to run the command `python start_project.py` in your CMD or Terminal, and the React application will open in your default web browser at 127.0.0.1!
* Please see the troubleshooting guide below if there are any issues.

**üîå Troubleshooting**
---
## üöÄ Application Won't Start

### Python Script Errors
- Make sure Python 3 is installed and properly added to your system‚Äôs PATH.
- Ensure you are using the command `python` for Windows or `python3` for MacOS/Linux to start the script.
- Verify that there are no syntax errors in the `start_project.py` file.

### Missing Modules
- If you get an ImportError, it means a Python module is missing. Make sure to run `pip install -r requirements.txt` within your virtual environment or install the necessary packages as per your `environment.yml`.

## üì¶ Dependency Installation Issues

### requirements.txt
- Ensure that you're running `pip install -r requirements.txt` inside the virtual environment. If you‚Äôre not in a virtual environment, consider creating one to avoid conflicts.
- If an error occurs during package installation, it may be a compatibility issue. Check if the packages are compatible with your Python version.

### Conda Environment
- If you have trouble creating the Conda environment from the `environment.yml` file, ensure that Anaconda/Miniconda is installed and updated to the latest version.
- Check the environment.yml file for syntax errors or unsupported packages.

## üóÉ Local Database Setup Problems

### PostgreSQL Connection
- Confirm that PostgreSQL is running on your machine.
- If `psql` command is not recognized, ensure that PostgreSQL bin directory is added to your system‚Äôs PATH.
- If you see a connection error, double-check that the username and password are correct and match those set during PostgreSQL installation.
- Use these links: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36155219/psql-command-not-found-mac, https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6790088/postgresql-bash-psql-command-not-found

### Database Script Execution
- Make sure you are in the correct directory (`./project/backend/db`) when you run the `psql -U username -d chatbot -f chatbot.sql` command.
- If you receive an error about missing files, verify that `chatbot.sql` exists in the directory.

### Setting Up User and Database in pgAdmin for Authentication Issues
If you are facing repetitive authentication issues, setting up a dedicated user and database might help. Here‚Äôs how to create a user named jib with a password 3315 and set up a database for it in pgAdmin:

#### Create a New Role:
1. Open pgAdmin and connect to your PostgreSQL server.
2. Right-click on "Login/Group Roles" and select "Create" -> "Login/Group Role".
3. Name the role `jib`.
4. In the "Definition" tab, set the password to `3315`.
5. In the "Privileges" tab, set "Can login?" to "Yes".

#### Create a Database:
1. Right-click on "Databases" and select "Create" -> "Database".
2. Name the database `chatbot`.
3. Set the owner to the previously created `jib` role.'

#### Configure Authentication:
* Ensure that the pg_hba.conf file (located in the PostgreSQL installation directory) is configured to allow the jib user to connect with the correct authentication method (e.g., MD5).

## üñº Frontend Issues

### npm Dependencies
- If npm dependencies fail to install, make sure you have Node.js installed and that npm is up to date.
- Check for errors in the console output ‚Äî they often provide clues about what went wrong.

### React Server
- If the React server won‚Äôt start, ensure that you are in the correct directory and that all npm dependencies are installed.
- Sometimes, the problem can be with a specific npm package. Try deleting the `node_modules` folder and the `package-lock.json` file and run `npm install` again.

## üåê Web Browser Issues

### Application Not Loading
- Ensure that no other services are running on the same port and that your firewall settings are not blocking the ports.
- Check the terminal for any errors indicating that the servers did not start correctly.
- If the application opens but does not function as expected, clear your browser cache and cookies, or try using a different browser.

## üêû General Debugging Steps

- Always read error messages carefully; they usually contain useful information about what went wrong.
- Check the console or terminal for stack traces or error logs that can point to the source of the issue.
- Ensure all environment variables and paths are set correctly.
- Restart your computer to resolve issues with ports or background processes that may affect the application.
